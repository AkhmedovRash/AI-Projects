This code implements a chatbot model based on the Encoder-Decoder LSTM architecture. It loads the dialog file, pre-processes the data and prepares it for training the model. The model is then built and compiled with the chosen optimizer and loss function. The model is trained on inputs and outputs, and then inference models are created to use the model in inference mode. You can then ask questions and receive answers from the chatbot.
The necessary modules and libraries are imported, including the file upload module, numpy, modules and classes from TensorFlow.keras for creating a neural network model, a module for working with YAML files, and a module for working with Google Drive.
The drive.mount() function mounts Google Drive in order to access the files.
A file with dialogs in YAML format is loaded using the open() function.
The conversations are extracted from the file and the number of question-answer pairs is displayed.
Dialogues are processed: questions and answers are extracted from conversations, extra characters are removed, and answers are framed with '<START>' and '<END>' tokens.
A tokenizer is created that collects a frequency dictionary from questions and answers.
The size of the dictionary is determined and a fragment of the dictionary is displayed.
Questions and answers are converted to sequences of tokens and padded with zeros to the maximum length.
The input and output data are loaded to train the model.
Model architecture is created using the Keras functional API.
The model is compiled with the chosen optimizer and loss function.
The model is trained on input and output data using the fit() function.
Inference models are created to use the model in inference mode.
The strToTokens() function converts a string into a sequence of tokens for input to the model.
In a loop, you can ask questions and receive answers from the chatbot using inference models.
